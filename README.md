# Stroke-Analysis

In this project, I will implement Naive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbour (K-NN) classifiers. I will explore inner workings and evaluate behavior on a data set of stroke prediction, and on this basis respond to some conceptual questions.

## Running

Split data sets into a training set and a hold-out test set

```
split_data()
```

Build Naive Bayes and K-NN classifiers from the training data

```
train()
```

Use a trained model to predict a class for the test data

```
predict()
```

Output the accuracy of your classifiers, or sufficient information so that it can be easily calculated by hand

```
evaluate()
```
